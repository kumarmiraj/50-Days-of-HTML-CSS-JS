          A trip to Jasper National Park in May 2025 is to witness a world in
          dramatic transition. It’s the secret shoulder season, where spring
          awakens in the valleys while winter holds its final, magnificent
          ground on the peaks. Near the Jasper townsite, you’ll find the park
          emerging from its slumber. Wildlife like elk, bighorn sheep, and even
          bears are active at lower elevations, grazing on the first green
          shoots. The local lakes, such as Pyramid and Patricia, are just
          beginning to shed their winter ice. The true adventure begins on the
          Icefields Parkway (Highway 93), one of the most stunning drives on
          Earth. In May, the roadside is alive with meltwater, feeding
          thundering waterfalls. A stop at Athabasca Falls is essential, as the
          river roars through its narrow canyon with peak springtime power. Your
          ultimate destination is the Athabasca Glacier at the Columbia
          Icefield. May marks the thrilling start of the glacier season. Here,
          you can board a massive Ice Explorer, a specially designed vehicle
          that drives directly onto the ancient river of ice. Stepping out, you
          are standing on ice that is hundreds of feet thick and thousands of
          years old. The sheer scale is humbling as you stare into deep, blue
          crevasses and taste pure glacial water.

          Visiting Jasper in May offers the best of both worlds: the raw power
          of the spring melt and the icy majesty of winter. Just be sure to pack
          layers—you’ll experience freezing temperatures on the glacier and
          mild, spring-like weather in the valley, all in a single afternoon.
